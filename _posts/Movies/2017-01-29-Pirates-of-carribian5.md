Captain Jack Sparrow finds the winds of ill-fortune blowing even more strongly when deadly ghost pirates led by his old nemesis, the terrifying Captain Salazar, escape from the Devil's Triangle, determined to kill every pirate at sea...including him. Captain Jack's only hope of survival lies in seeking out the legendary Trident of Poseidon, a powerful artifact that bestows upon its possessor total control over the seas.

Captain Salazar, a deadly ghost escapes the Devil's triangle with his crew and is taking over the seas in search of his arch-rival and author of all his pain, Jack Sparrow. In the meantime, Jack is approached by a boy who needs to locate the Trident of Poseidon, something he believes only Sparrow can help him find. Carina Smyth an astronomer and horologist joins the team to help them find something she believes her father had always wanted her to find. Jack's only hope is to find the mythical Trident of Poseidon, who's master gets control of all the seas, or so it's said.
