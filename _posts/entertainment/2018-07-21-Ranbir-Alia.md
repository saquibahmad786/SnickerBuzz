### Ranbir Kapoor on his relationship with Alia Bhatt: What she gives is something that I’m aspiring for myself

Sanju actor Ranbir Kapoor revealed that his and Alia Bhatt's relationship is still new.

In a recent interview to GQ, Ranbir Kapoor spoke about his “new” relationship with Alia Bhatt. When asked if the two were dating, Ranbir said, “It’s really new right now, and I don’t want to over speak. It needs time to breathe and it needs space. As an actor, as a person, Alia is – what’s the right word? – flowing right now. When I see her work, when I see her act, even in life, what she gives is something that I’m aspiring to for myself. It’s new for us, so let it cook a bit.”

The two also attended Sonam Kapoor’s wedding reception together and later Alia even shared their picture on Instagram as well.

On being asked if the link-up stories affected her, Alia said, “The truth never bothers me. At the same time, even lies don’t affect me because if it’s not true, I don’t care. Link-up rumours don’t affect my relationships with people. We have gotten used to it because it is a part and parcel of being in the business and limelight.”

Alia had recently shared her thoughts on marriage when she said that she might surprise everyone around by marrying before she’s 30. Here, she said, “I would never fear getting married thinking my career might end. I will settle down if I want to. One should be able to have a career, regardless of being married or not.
