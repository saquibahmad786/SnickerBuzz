Karenjit Kaur – the untold story of Sunny Leone’ trailer begins with present-day Sunny Leone sitting in a make-up room. She is getting ready for an interview where the anchor introduces her as actress loved in India as much as she hated by many. It takes her back in time where it all began. Sunny Leone was born as Karenjit Kaur Vohra to an Indian family in Canada. The trailer depicts her struggles as a teenager and how her family's financial condition lead her to become an adult movie star. 

‘Karenjit Kaur – the untold story of Sunny Leone’ also has a reference to 2016 TV interview where she faced sexist and misogynist questions with grace and confidence on camera. The trailer ends with the hard-hitting dialogue that sums up her life. When asked that many assume that there is is no difference between an adult star and a porn star. Sunny Leone replies, 'There is one similar...GUTS'
